        <p id="descr-text">This cat loves to chat a lot. He speaks even when asked to be quiet by the older cats.
            Will always find a way to say something. He loves to joke around and be nice. But despite his playfulness,
            he is lonely without a friend by his side. He really wants to communicate with a cat-girl. Beautiful cat
            girl. You must be wondering why his name is Fire Lover? Well, I don't know myself, let's ask him next time
            you see him.
